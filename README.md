# ðŸ¤‘ TotalBill
A single-screen application that implements the function of convenient bill splitting after going to a cafe or restaurant.

## ðŸ“² Now let's see how this application works:

The application consists of 1 screen, which contains all the functionality. This is what the screen looks like after launching the application.

<br />

For the normal working of the application, you must enter the total amount of money, the number of people and the tip you want to leave.

<br />

If all the information is entered correctly, then an alert appears on the screen, which shows the total summ for 1 person.

If incorrect information is entered in any of the fields, an alert appears on the screen that warns of an error.
